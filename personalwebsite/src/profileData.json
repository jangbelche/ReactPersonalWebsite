My Basketball journey has taken me around the world, whether it is playing at my local club in Luxembourg, playing pick-up at boarding school in the US, or playing street mode in the suburbs of Nepal. I currently play for the University of Manchester Basketball Club, where I am the current Club Captain.",

Pushing your body to more and more challenging goals is one of the most satisfying feelings I have. I run for physical and mental fitness and love to explore cities or nature while running. Favorite distance: 21k",
